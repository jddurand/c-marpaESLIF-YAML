BASIC INSTALLATION

To install this module, just do:
 
  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install  (this step may need to be done as the superuser)
 
Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't require
the "./" notation, you can do this:
 
  perl Build.PL
  Build
  Build test
  Build install
 
The important thing is that the "Build" script gets executed and that
you pass it the "test", "install", etc. arguments.
